description: 'Three strands of deep black obsidian shine against antiqued silver cone beads for a dazzling look. These handcrafted cone beads are forged in fine silver by the respected Hill Tribes silversmiths of northern Thailand. A finely detailed hook clasp provides the finishing touch. Wear it long, or double it over as a six-strand necklace for a richer look.  Obsidian is a brilliant natural black -- not dyed like black onyx and other more commonly-used black stones. All metals are .925 sterling silver. Necklace strands measure 34, 36, and 38 inches (86, 91, and 96 cm) respectively.  N3-OB-SS-0001'

Three strands of deep black obsidian shine against antiqued silver cone beads for a dazzling look. These handcrafted cone beads are forged in fine silver by the respected Hill Tribes silversmiths of northern Thailand. A finely detailed hook clasp provides the finishing touch. Wear it long, or double it over as a six-strand necklace for a richer look. 

Obsidian is a brilliant natural black -- not dyed like black onyx and other more commonly-used black stones. All metals are .925 sterling silver. Necklace strands measure 34, 36, and 38 inches (86, 91, and 96 cm) respectively.
