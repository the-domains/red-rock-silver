# Garnet Triple-Strand Bracelet
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d8a8ca39-e11f-4c99-a3a2-8d71e1e0e60e.JPG)

Three strands of glossy pomegranate-colored garnet with touches of silver. Conveniently secured with a magnetic clasp. See a short demo clip of our magnetic clasps at https://youtu.be/JIyBiPAde-s

All metals are .925 sterling silver. Some of these garnet stones are natural (the flat, teardrop shaped ones) and the others were hand-cut, tumbled and faceted, and then dyed to enhance their rich merlot red color. Measures 8 inches (20 cm).
